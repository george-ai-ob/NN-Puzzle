# Neural Network Puzzle Game

This project will be a web page which shows the user a puzzle (or puzzles) where there is a set problem to be solved by the network, and a fixed set of input nodes and output nodes, the user can then alter the hidden layer(s) to see how well the network can solve the problem with different structures.

I will be using p5.js to visualise the network and create interactivity.
